# Bench-Ranker

This module is used to benchmark user's big data solutions with  a prescriptive performance analysis approach. Bench-Ranker reduces the time required to calculate the rankings, obtain useful visualizations, and determine the best performing configurations of the user. Furthermore, the key performance index of this module is extensible to anything that is measurable for a specific implementation (i.e. query runtimes). Bench-Ranker also provides an easy and interactive environment with python's Jupyter Notebook making it easy for users to get insights of their data.

To make the module scalable over the configurations space, Bench-Ranker allows plug in of any number of dimensions into the solution space for example the schemas, partitioning, and storage format.
