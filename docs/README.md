Prescriptive Performance Analysis in Python Actions 

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/487547762.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/487547762)

This library provides prescriptive analysis for the complex solution space of (RDF relational schema, Partitioning, and Storage Formats) that emerges with querying large RDF graphs over Relational Big Data (BD) System, e.g., Apache Spark-SQL.

#### PAPyA Impact, Design Aspects, Avaiblability and Resuability 
| Aspect | Description |
| :---: | :-: |
| Does the resource break new ground? | No, This work is derived from previous paper |
| Does the resource fill an important gap? | Yes, This system help reduce the time needed to perform a prescriptive performance analysis of BD engine |
|How does the resource advance the state of the art?||
|Has the resource been compared to other existing resources (if any) of similar scope?|No, to the best of our knowledge currently there are no framework that applies the prescriptive performance approach of big data analysis|
|Is the resource of interest to the Semantic Web community?|Yes, this resource aims to automate performance analysis of big data solutions by using a prescriptive performance analysis approach|
|Is the resource of interest to society in general?|Yes, the resource can be of interest for society in general but it is mainly used for BigData practitioners|
|Will/has the resource have/had an impact, especially in supporting the adoption of Semantic Web technologies?|Yes, this resource will make an impact in support of the Semantic Web technologies|
